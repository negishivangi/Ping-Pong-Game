# Ping-Pong-Game
Java implementation of a self-learning computer player for the indoor game Ping Pong. The idea has been to only provide the player with information about the board state and allowed moves in order to force it to learn all the relevant game concepts on its own. During training, the computer player has been evaluated against the user. The player has also been evaluated against specific states to determine if it is learning important game concepts such as defense (preventing the ball from hitting the wall on its side) and attack (making sure the user misses the ball).
